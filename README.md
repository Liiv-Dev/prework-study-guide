# Willie's Prework Study Guide 

## Description

    - My motivation comes from wanting a career change and wanting to walk a path of oppotunities and eventful memories.
    
    - This project was created to help understand what i'll be learning in uncoming coding courses and to have notes to look back on whenever I feel stuck.

    - I learned coding is an unique skill to have. Opens doors for opportunity and it pushes me to learn more whenever I have time.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
